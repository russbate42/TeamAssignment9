I added what I believe to be the correct files in the correct ways using the right implementations of the comparators.
the field variable in Bank.java should NOT be changed because I asked for her help. However, there needs to be one more field variable
from what I understand in order to get the getAccounts() function working properly. As it is, there is a boatload of compile errors. 
Best of luck. I emailed her with no response back yet, because as usual her instructions are like a pile of hot garbage.
